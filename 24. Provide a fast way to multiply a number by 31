/* Left shift the number by 5 bits and subtract the number once. For e.g., If the number is 10 left shift by 5 bits gives.

Left Shift by 1 bit is multiplication by 2
Left Shift by 5 bits is multiplication by 32

Since we need to multiply by 31 what we do is multiply the number by 32 and subtract the number once. /*

#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
int T,n;
scanf("%d",&T);
n=T;
n=n<<5;
n=n-T;
printf("%d",n);
