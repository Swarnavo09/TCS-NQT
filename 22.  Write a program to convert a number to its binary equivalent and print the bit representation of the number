//Method 1 ( Using Bit Operators & Masking )

/* In this method we create a mask with the most significant bit set and And ( &) the mask and the number. If the result is 0 then we know that the Most Significant Bit (MSB) of the number is 0. If the result is 1 then the MSB of the number is 1. Then we right shift the mask by 1 bit and repeat the process.*/
